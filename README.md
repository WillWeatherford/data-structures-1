# linked-list
Implements a linked list with python

This repo holds sample code for some classic data structures, implemented in Python, including singly- and doubly-linked lists and stacks. Singly-linked lists are convenient for keeping a group of data nodes in order; adding and removing them is simple and efficient. They are most useful when we only need to traverse our data in one direction. Doubly-linked lists make their nodes more accessible since they can be inserted or removed at either end of the list; but navigating the list is costlier.

It's a joint project of Michael Sullivan and A.J. Wohlfert.
